    <p>A higher-order function is a function that uses another function, either taking in a function as a parameter, or returning a function as a result.
        JavaScript's ability to implement higher-order functions is what makes JavaScript a functional programming language.
        Using higher order functions can make your code more readable and improve your productivity. Filters are a common use-case of higher-order functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this JSBin, I created an array containing a list of different colors.
        I then created a list of filters based on the toggle states of the color buttons, and filtered down the colors array using the list of filters.
