    <h2 id="hof">Higher-Order Functions</h2>
    <p>A higher-order function is a function that uses another function, either taking in a function as a parameter, or returning a function as a result.
        JavaScript's ability to implement higher-order functions is what makes JavaScript a functional programming language.
        Using higher order functions can make your code more readable and improve your productivity. Filters are a common use-case of higher-order functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this JSBin, I created an array containing a list of different colors.
        I then created a list of filters based on the toggle states of the color buttons, and filtered down the colors array using the list of filters.

    <h2 id="map">Map</h2>
    <p>Map is a higher-order function built into the JavaScript language. Map takes an array, performs a transformation on each of the elements in the array,
        and returns a new array containing those transformed elements.
        Just like filters, using maps reduces the number of lines of code you need to write compared to doing the same transformation with a for loop.
    </p>
    <p>
        I made an array of words and used map to reverse each of the words.

    <h2 id="reduce">Reduce</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Reduce is a higher-order function that, similar to map and filter, applies a function against each item in an array.
        Each time the function passed to reduce is called, the first parameter is the returned value of the last call to the function.
        The second parameter is the current item in the array.
    </p>
    <p>The genericness of reduce makes it helpful for solving a variety of problems.
        I recently used reduce at work to merge rows of data that shared the same value on a particular field.
        In this JSBin, I created an array of objects with different symbols and colors. I used reduce to merge the objects that had the same symbol and color.
